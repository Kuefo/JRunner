# Contributing Guidelines

These examples will show the guidelines for contributing. Please try to follow this at all times, or we may not merge your contribution.

## Basic Guidelines:
- Try to keep a consistent formatting style, preferably the same as other code, this helps keeping code easy to read!
- Do not include any copyrighted software or intellectual property
- Test your work before committing/submitting a pull request
- Changes must support at least Windows Vista or later, Windows XP support is optional

## Forks, Branches, and Merging
Please fork the repository and commit your changes there. We suggest using the "next" branch as this is where development is done. When you are ready for us to look over your work, submit a pull request following our pull request template, and we will look over it. If there is an issue that needs to be resolved before merging, then we will leave a comment on the pull request.
